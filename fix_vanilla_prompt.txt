Please inspect this project, taking special note of the 
powershell scripts in the commands folder.

Note that when an R script is invoked, the current powershell 
scrips invoke RScript.exe using the --vanilla option.
This is a problem because I want these scripts to work with 
renv and as such, they must use the local .Rprofile file.
When the --vanilla is used, this causes RScript to not use
the local renv .Rprofile file.  This means that when 
a script is executed for a renv project, it does not use 
the local environment because the contents of the 
local .Rprofile file are not executed.

When --vanilla is removed, then the powershell script just
hangs for some reason.

Please resolve this problem so that the powershell script
works with renv.

Ensure realtime streaming from the R process is working
-------------------------------------------------------

Please examine this project carefully.  Also pay particular attention 
to the run_background.ps1 script.  This script executes the targets project in 
this folder.  Note that this project runs in a renv environment.  
The run_background.ps1 works but currently it only shows me the console 
output from R, upon completion.  I need it to stream R’s console output in 
real time so that I can see the targets output as it happens. Please update 
Invoke-Rscripts.ps1 to allow this to happen.
